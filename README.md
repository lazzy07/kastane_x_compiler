## Project Structure

This project is designed to be highly portable, if you dont need `Data Structures` created, you can turn it off.

## Testing

To test this project, you need to have `Sabre Benchmark Problem Files`, you can get them from the original [Sabre-Benchmarks Repository](https://github.com/sgware/sabre-benchmarks/tree/main/problems)

## Network Connection

This project will download some vendor libraries from `Github`, so to build this project, active internet connection is required!.
